This document explains the format of files in webice/data/dcs directory.

- beamstop_z

Beam stop distance. Line 4 contains current value, max and min (plus other
values not used by webice). 
Used to check (and give warnings) if the calculated distance 
(for low resolution limit of 40 Anstrom) is within limits.
 

For example:

beamstop_z
1
gi beamstopz
40.005080 42.005334 16.494158 62.992000 650 100 30 0 1 0 0 1 0 mm
0
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1

The above has current beam stop distance = 40.005080,
max distance = 42.005334 and min distance = 16.494158.


- energy

Same format as beamstop_z. 
Used to check (and give warnings) if the calculated energy (for predicted resolution) is within limits.

- detector_z_corr

Detector to sample distance. Same format as beamstop_z. 
Used to check (and give warnings) if the calculated distance (for predicted resolution) is within limits.

- beam_size_x

Same format as beamstop_z. Used by raddose.

- beam_size_y
Same format as beamstop_z. Used by raddose.

- detectorType
Detector type on line 4. One of the following values: MAR325, MAR165, MAR345, Q315CCD, Q4CCD, MAR345.
Used to compared to the detector type found in image header as a way to ensure that the user
selects the correct beamline for the given image for strategy calculation. 
Used to determine detector size and calculate maximum detector resolution.


- lastImageCollected
Last image collected by DCS. Used in the Image tab when user clicks "Last Image" button to see
the last collected image if connected to the beamline (beamline selected from tool bar).

- screeningActionList
Used to determine which crystal is currently mounted at the beamline. Only used at SSRL.

- robot_cassette
Used to determine which crystal is currently mounted at the beamline. Only used at SSRL.

- sequenceDeviceState
Used to determine which crystal is currently mounted at the beamline. Only used at SSRL.

- crystalSelectionList
Used to determine which crystal is currently mounted at the beamline. Only used at SSRL.

- sil_id
Used to determine which crystal is currently mounted at the beamline. Only used at SSRL.
