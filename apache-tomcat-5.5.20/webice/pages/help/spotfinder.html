<h1>Spotfinder</h1>

<p>
In the output JPEG image, different features are painted in different colors
</p>
<ul><li>      yellow:   overloaded pixel</li>
<li>      red:      local maxima (spot peak)</li>
<li>      green:    border of a good spot</li>
 <li>     white:    border of a spot with close neighbors</li>
<li>      red:      border of a spot with multiple peaks</li>
<li>      yellow:   border of a spot with overloaded pixels</li>
<li>      magenta:  central line of an ice-ring</li>
<li>      blue:     image resolution limit by method 1 (short dashes)</li>
<li>      blue:     image resolution limit by method 2 (long dashes)</li>
</ul>
   <p>In the output IMG image, features are less distinguishable due to limited colors.
   The following features are indicated:</p> 
<ul><li>      overloaded pixel:                                yellow</li>
<li>      border of good spots:                            yellow</li>
<li>      central line of ice-ring:                        yellow</li>
<li>      resolution limit by method 1 (short dashes):     yellow</li>
<li>      resolution limit by method 2 (long dashes):      yellow</li>
 <li>     local maxima:                                    white</li>
<li>      border of bad spots(peak overloaded, have close neighbors, or have multiple peaks):                             white</li>
</ul>        

  <p> The program shows a brief summary of each image it has processed.
   Statistics shown include:
   </p>    
<ol>
<li>number of spots vs number of overloaded, multiple maxima, with-close-neighbor
spots.</li>
<li> spot size median (pixel**2??) shape median (0 - 1, the bigger the better -more
roundish.</li>
<li>Estimate of the high resolution limit by two different methods</li>
<li>Badness of the curve for the image resolution estimates; the
smaller the better.</li>
 <li>Number of ice rings and, if existent, intensity and location of ice ring.
</li>
<li>Size of largest overloaded patch and whether the largest overloaded patch lies on an 
ice ring</li>
</ol>

<li>The most useful criteria to determine the quality of an image are:</li>
<ol>
<li>Ratio of number of spots to overloaded, split or close to other spots. The higher,
the better</li>
<li>Number of ice rings</li>
<li>Closeness of the two image resolution estimates, from Method 1 and 2.
If they are very different there may be something wrong with the image.</li>
</ol>
