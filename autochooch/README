# Revision 2.0

#
# - Based on Benny Benny-3.01, Chooch 4.0.1 and wasel 1.2
# - Added a new makefile to build all decunix, irix and linux.
# - Added chooch_remote.sh borne shell script to
#   be used in place of autochooch by an impersonation 
#   server.

autochooch consists of Benny_auto (FORTRAN), Chooch_auto (FORTRAN) 
and wasel (C) programs. These programs can be run as a 
batch by a shell script. autochooch shell script, written
in c-shell, runs Chooch_auto.sh and wasel_auto c-shell scripts.
Blu-ice used to run autochooch from the Fluorescence scan tab.

The new version of Blue-ice no longer runs the autochooch shell script.
Instead, it delegates the task to the scripting engine and the impersonation
dhs via an operation. The impersonation dhs, in turn, sends an HTTP message 
to the impersonation server to run runs chooch_remote.sh script
on behalf of the user who issued the operation from blu-ice. 
chooch_remote.sh is a borne shell script that does a 
similar job as autochooch. The only differences are the formats 
of some input and output.

See README.Install for installation instructions.
