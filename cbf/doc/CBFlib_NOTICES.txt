                              The IUCr Policy
         for the Protection and the Promotion of the STAR File and
         CIF Standards for Exchanging and Archiving Electronic Data

  Overview

   The Crystallographic Information File (CIF)[1] is a standard for
   information interchange promulgated by the International Union of
   Crystallography (IUCr). CIF (Hall, Allen & Brown, 1991) is the
   recommended method for submitting publications to Acta
   Crystallographica Section C and reports of crystal structure
   determinations to other sections of Acta Crystallographica and many
   other journals. The syntax of a CIF is a subset of the more general
   STAR File[2] format. The CIF and STAR File approaches are used
   increasingly in the structural sciences for data exchange and
   archiving, and are having a significant influence on these activities
   in other fields.

  Statement of intent

   The IUCr's interest in the STAR File is as a general data interchange
   standard for science, and its interest in the CIF, a conformant
   derivative of the STAR File, is as a concise data exchange and
   archival standard for crystallography and structural science.

  Protection of the standards

   To protect the STAR File and the CIF as standards for interchanging
   and archiving electronic data, the IUCr, on behalf of the scientific
   community,

   * holds the copyrights on the standards themselves,

   * owns the associated trademarks and service marks, and

   * holds a patent on the STAR File.

   These intellectual property rights relate solely to the interchange
   formats, not to the data contained therein, nor to the software used
   in the generation, access or manipulation of the data.

  Promotion of the standards

   The sole requirement that the IUCr, in its protective role, imposes on
   software purporting to process STAR File or CIF data is that the
   following conditions be met prior to sale or distribution.

   * Software claiming to read files written to either the STAR File or
   the CIF standard must be able to extract the pertinent data from a
   file conformant to the STAR File syntax, or the CIF syntax,
   respectively.

   * Software claiming to write files in either the STAR File, or the
   CIF, standard must produce files that are conformant to the STAR File
   syntax, or the CIF syntax, respectively.

   * Software claiming to read definitions from a specific data
   dictionary approved by the IUCr must be able to extract any pertinent
   definition which is conformant to the dictionary definition language
   (DDL)[3] associated with that dictionary.

   The IUCr, through its Committee on CIF Standards, will assist any
   developer to verify that software meets these conformance conditions.

  Glossary of terms

   [1] CIF:

   is a data file conformant to the file syntax defined at
   http://www.iucr.org/iucr-top/cif/spec/index.html

   [2] STAR File:

   is a data file conformant to the file syntax defined at
   http://www.iucr.org/iucr-top/cif/spec/star/index.html

   [3] DDL:

   is a language used in a data dictionary to define data items in terms
   of "attributes". Dictionaries currently approved by the IUCr, and the
   DDL versions used to construct these dictionaries, are listed at
   http://www.iucr.org/iucr-top/cif/spec/ddl/index.html
