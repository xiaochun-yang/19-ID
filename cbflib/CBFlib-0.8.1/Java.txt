An initial set of Java wrapper classes for CBFlib-0.8.0 has been
implemented using SWIG. A pair of example programs (testcbf.c and
testcbf.java) are included that show the similarities and differences
of using CBFlib in C and Java.

This has been tested using Red Hat EL 4.7 WS for i568 and Red Hat EL
5.3 WS for x86_64 with Sun's JDK.

In addition to the static methods in org.iucr.cbflib.cbf, six helper
classes are included: four wrapper classes for C pointers that point
to size_t (sizetP), int (intP), unsigned int (uintP) and double
(doubleP); two wrapper classes for C arrays that hold int (intArray)
and double (doubleArray). Also, some helper functions for a pointer to
pointer to char (charPP_*) aid the output of strings, and pointer
casts to void (int_void and double_void). Finally, a constructor and a
destructor has been added to the cbf_handle_struct class.
