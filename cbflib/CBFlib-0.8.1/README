                  Before using this software, please read the
                                     NOTICE
for important disclaimers and the IUCr Policy on the Use of the Crystallographic
            Information File (CIF) and other important information.

   Work on imgCIF and CBFlib supported in part by the U. S. Department of
   Energy (DOE) under grants ER63601-1021466-0009501 and

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   CBFLIB is a library of ANSI-C functions providing a simple mechanism for
   accessing Crystallographic Binary Files (CBF files) and Image-supporting
   CIF (imgCIF) files. The CBFLIB API is loosely based on the CIFPARSE API
   for mmCIF files. Starting with this release, CBFLIB performs validation
   checks on reading of a CBF. If a dictionary is provided, values will be
   validated against dictionary ranges and enumerations. Tags missing under
   parent-child relationships or category key requirements will be reported.
   CBFlib provides functions to create, read, modify and write CBF binary
   data files and imgCIF ASCII data files.

  Installation

   CBFLIB should be built on a disk with at least 350 megabytes of free
   space, for a full installation with complete tests. Read the instructions
   below carefully, if space is a problem.

   CBFlib_0.7.9.tar.gz is a "gzipped" tar of the code as it now stands.

   In addition, CBFlib_0.7.9_Data_Files_Input.tar.gz (13 MB) is a "gzipped"
   tar of the input data files needed to test the API,
   CBFlib_0.7.9_Data_Files_Output.tar.gz (34 MB) is a "gzipped" tar of the
   output data files needed to test the API, and, if space is at a premium,
   CBFlib_0.7.9_Data_Files_Output_Sigs_Only.tar.gz (1KB) is a "gzipped" tar
   of only the MD5 signatures of the output data files needed to test the
   API. Place the CBFlib_0.7.9.tar.gz file in the directory that is intended
   to contain up to 4 new directories, named CBFlib_0.7.9 (the "top-level"
   directory), CBFlib_0.7.9_Data_Files_Input and either
   CBFlib_0.7.9_Data_Files_Output or
   CBFlib_0.7.9_Data_Files_Output_Sigs_Only. If you have wget on your
   machine, you only need to download the source tarball. If you do not have
   wget, you will need to download all the tarballs into the same directory

   Uncompress CBFlib_0.7.9.tar.gz with gunzip and unpack it with tar:

      gunzip CBFlib_0.7.9.tar.gz
      tar xvf CBFLIB_0.7.9.tar

   To run the test programs, you will also need Paul Ellis's sample MAR345
   image, example.mar2300, Chris Nielsen's sample ADSC Quantum 315 image,
   mb_LP_1_001.img, and Eric Eikenberry's SLS sample Pilatus 6m image,
   insulin_pilatus6m, as sample data. In addition there are is a PDB mmCIF
   file, 9ins.cif, and 3 special test files testflatin.cbf,
   testflatpackedin.cbf and testrealin.cbf. All these files will be dowloaded
   and extracted by the Makefile from CBFlib_0.7.9_Data_Files_Input. Do not
   download copies into the top level directory.

   After unpacking the archives, the top-level directory should contain a
   makefile:

                           Makefile   Makefile for unix 

   and the subdirectories:

     src/           CBFLIB source files                                       
     include/       CBFLIB header files                                       
                                                                              
     bin/           Executable example programs                               
     doc/           Documentation                                             
     examples/      Example program source files                              
     html_images/   JPEG images used in rendering the HTML files              
     lib/           Compiled CBFLIB (libcbf.a) and FCBLIB (libfcb.a)          
                  libraries                                                   
     m4/            CBFLIB m4 macro files (used to build .f90 files)          
     mswin/         An MS Windows CodeWarrior project file                    
     pycbf/         Jon Wright's Python bindings                              

   and additional Makefiles for other systems. All the makefiles are created
   from m4/Makefile.m4. The current set of Makefiles are Makefile_LINUX,
   Makefile_LINUX_gcc42, Makefile_OSX, Makefile_OSX_gcc42, Makefile_AIX and
   Makefile_MINGW. Edit the closest approximation to your system, and then
   copy that variant to Makefile. For instructions on compiling and testing
   the library, go to the top-level directory and type:

      make

   Once you have a properly configure Makefile, compile and test the package
   with

      make tests

   or, if space is at a premium, with

      make tests_sigs_only

   Please refer to the manual doc/CBFlib.html for more detailed information.
