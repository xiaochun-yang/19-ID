			ADSC X4A DISTRIBUTION SOFTWARE 

This directory represents the ADSC code that Chris Neilson developed for the
X4A beamline to run under Fedora Core 3.  It also represents the changes I
made to some of the file permissions to make it work (did a chmod 666 on the
marcollect and xf_status files in the /usr/local/ccd_dist/tmp directory).
