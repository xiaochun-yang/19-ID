        ====================

Send:		RDION\rCDONE\r

Receive:	+x.xxx\r\n+y.yyy\r\n+z.zzz\r\nCMD_DONE\r\n

Synchronization:	The command is finished when you see
			the string CMD_DONE in the returned stream.

Upstream Ion x.xxx, Downstream is y.yyy, Beam is z.zzz.
	"+" is can be + or - in the return string.

	Slit readback
	=============

Send:		`CCGETSLITPOSITIONS\r

		delay for 100 msec

Receive:	xxxx.x\r\nyyyy.y\r\nzzzz.z\r\nwwww.w\r\nxl_done

		xxxx.x	Beam defining slits Height
		yyyy.y  Beam defining slits Width
		zzzz.z  Guard Slit Height
		wwww.w  Guard Slit Width

Synchronization:	The command is finished when you see
			the string xl_done in the returned stream.

	Setting Halfslits
	=================

Send a string from the following list:

Which halfslit		Set IN		Set OUT
-------------		------		-------

Horizontal Upstream	1OUT.9-1	1OUT.9-0
Vertical Upstream	1OUT.10-1	1OUT.10-0
Horizontal Downstream	1OUT.11-1	1OUT.11-0
Vertical Downstream	1OUT.12-1	1OUT.12-0

Example:		1OUT.11-1\rCDONE\r

Receive:		CMD_DONE\r\n

Synchronization:	The command is finished when you see
			the string CMD_DONE in the returned stream.

	Setting Slits
	=============

Send:		`CCSETSLITPOSITION\r

Receive:	line1\r\nline2\r\n ... linex\r\nxl_end

		Each "line1", "line2", etc., above will be of the
		form      
			`ms....\r\n    
		In other words, each returned line starts with `ms
		and some number of characters which follow until
		the \r\n.

		You then send each line, omitting the \n, back to
		the goniostat controller.

		Example:

Send:		`CCSETSLITPOSITION\r

Receive:	`msTalk\r\n`msEcho=OFF\r\nxl_end

	You then send:

		`msTalk\r`msEcho=OFF\r
	back to the goniostat.

	You will then receive many characters back. Ignore all of them
	except for the colon (:).  When the colon is received, the slit
	motion is finished.

Synchronization:	The : marks the end of the motion.
