Declaration of function ByteFree in include/dvmbasic.h in the 
original tar file is incorrect. It was declared with an empty argument.
Instead, it should be

void ByteFree(ByteImage *);

The original static libraries in linux directory extracted from
the binary distribution package (tar/dali1.0-bin-linux-i586.tar.gz)
are not compatible with new linux versions. They were henced
removed. dali libraries must be built directly from the 
source (tar/dali1.0-src.tar.gz).

The additional directories, packages and unix, were extracted 
from tar/dali1.0-src.tar.gz and copied to this dir. Makefile 
in unix dir was generated by the 'configure' script.

Some modifications were  made to the 'all' target in the Makefile
so that only the static libraries are built and not the 
shared libraries for tcl interface. This is because main.c 
failed to build due to 'bcopy' conflict errors. The 'install' 
target was also modified to copy unix/lib/*.a to linux dir.
The 'clean' target deletes *.a and *.so in linux dir in addition
to the files in unix/lib and unix/obj directories.

Everything in this cvs project, except this readme file, are 
downloaded from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/dali/.

Checked it in to cvs in case one day the web site no longer exists.
