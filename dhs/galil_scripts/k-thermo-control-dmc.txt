REM K-thermocouple control (SCB-48306 directly plug in DMC4080 analog inputs) 

REM with SCB-48306/48316 Signal condition card
REM made for K thermocouple with 6 input.
REM range 0--350C. constant=10.15mv/degree C

REM This program is running in the memory of the DMC-4080

REM set inputs 0-5V with AQ ie. AQ x,3 (x channel, 3 0-5)
REM I think MI and AQ can be burned in the memory of RIO-47xxx.

REM This program will read the analog input for K thermocouple
REM from DMC analog inputs. If the input
REM temperature is higher than required one. Then set the output
REM 15 (digital output port 1 is directly connect to the ELO input
REM to 1 (SB 1). It trigger ELO (turn the motor drive current off).
REM It will reenable the ELO (turn the motor current on) once the
REM temperture is below the required one.
REM DO1-8 for ABCD axis, DO9-16 for EFGH axis.
REM for the first 4 motor ABCD D01 connect to ELO
REM for the last 4 motor EFGH D09 connect ELO

REM REM dosen't taking execution time. NO and 'comments takes
REM excution time. the fillowing ' for the comments should be
REM removed in the real excution 
REM this program is only for the first 4 motors
