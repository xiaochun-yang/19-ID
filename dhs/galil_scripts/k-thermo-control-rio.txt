REM RIO-47xxx as a slave (IP 10.0.0.30)
REM with SCB-48306/48316 Signal condition card
REM made for K thermocouple with 6 input.
REM range 0--350C. constant=10.15mv/degree C

REM DMC-4080 as a master 
REM This program is running in the memory of the DMC-4080


REM RIO47xxx have following options configure
REM MI 0 (32 bit analog input)
REM The register address for this option will be
REM input 0 ---- xxx0
REM input 1 ---- xxx2
REM  ....
REM input 7 -----xxx14 
REM MI 1 (16 bit analog input)
REM input 0 ---- xxx0
REM input 1 ---- xxx1
REM  ....
REM input 7 -----xxx7 

REM set inputs 0-5V with AQ ie. AQ x,3 (x channel, 3 0-5)
REM I think MI and AQ can be burned in the memory of RIO-47xxx.

REM port 502 is used for Modbus addressing
REM I/O number = Handlenumberx1000 + bitnumber
REM ie. IHB ---handlenumber=1  input 0 (register 0) bitnumber 0
REM I/O number = 1000 (decimal)


REM This program will read the analog input for K thermocouple
REM from RIO-47000 (slave) using modbus address. If the input
REM temperature is higher than required one. Then set the output
REM 15 (digital output port 1 is directly connect to the ELO input
REM to 1 (SB 1). It trigger ELO (turn the motor drive current off).
REM It will reenable the ELO (turn the motor current on) once the
REM temperture is below the required one.
REM DO1-8 for ABCD axis, DO9-16 for EFGH axis.

REM REM dosen't taking execution time. NO and 'comments takes
REM excution time. the fillowing ' for the comments should be
REM removed in the real excution
