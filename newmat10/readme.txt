Everything in this directory, except makfile, is dowloaded 
from http://www.robertnz.net. The source files in src 
are extracted from tar/newmat10.tar.gz. 

The makefile in the top directory should be used to create
the library and the object files in the appropriate dir:
irix, decunix and linux. 

The makefiles in src/nm_*.mak can also be used to 
build the library but the object files and the binary
files will be generated in the src dir.
